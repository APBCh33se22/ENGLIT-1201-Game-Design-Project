    //IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE

    //Fix finish line
    //Reaching finish line before time runs out should take you to a victory scene
    //Timer running out should take you to a game over scene
    //THIS MUST GET DONE
    
    //Tom Gordon hallucinations, disappear on approach
    
    //Either AI movement using the NavMesh package
    //Or just have a black bear sprite appear around you occasionally
    //and it gets closer if you stand still

    //If we get the black bear working, scatter Walkmans around the map
    //If the bear gets close, press spacebar to throw Walkman
    //This stuns the bear, causing its movement to stop for a set amount of time
